# neosolarized.nvim

A truecolor, solarized dark colorscheme using [tjdevries/colorbuddy.vim](https://github.com/tjdevries/colorbuddy.vim) for neovim.

Based on [NeoSolarized](https://github.com/overcache/NeoSolarized).

## Why?

I've used a bunch of solarized themes. The best I have found is NeoSolarized. Despite it
being fantastic, like most themes, I wanted to tweak it here and there and really wanted a
lua solution for this in the style of the latest and greatest neovim plugins. TJ's
[colorbuddy](https://github.com/tjdevries/colorbuddy.vim) plugin makes dealing with colors in neovim
a pleasant experience. All the solarized colors and groups defined by this plugin are returned back
to you in the setup call for reuse.

## Limitations

- dark only
- termguicolors only
- neovim only

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [colorbuddy](https://github.com/tjdevries/colorbuddy.vim) installed.

## Installation

Install the plugin with your preferred package manager:

## [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
-- lua
{
  "svrana/neosolarized.nvim",
  lazy = false,
  priority = 1000,
  config = function()
    require("neosolarized").setup({
      comment_italics = true,
      background_set = false,
    })
    vim.cmd.colorscheme("neosolarized")
  end,
  dependencies = {
    "tjdevries/colorbuddy.nvim",
  },
}
```

### Setup

After installing colorbuddy and neosolarized.nvim with your favorite package manager add
the following lua snippet to your init.vim:

```
lua << EOF
  require('neosolarized').setup({
    comment_italics = true,
    background_set = false,
  })
EOF

colorscheme neosolarized
```

Example above is with the default settings that assumes a transparent terminal. If you
would like this colorscheme to set the background (as in the screenshots above) change the
`background_set` option to true, i.e.,

```
lua << EOF
  require('neosolarized').setup({
    comment_italics = true,
    background_set = true,
  })
EOF

colorscheme neosolarized
```

### Customization

neosolarized aims to be simple to customize.

The following is how I setup neosolarized. Ihis changes the color of the WarningMsg
(currently used by some code actions) to a less visible color by linking the group to a
predefined group.

```
lua << EOF
  n = require('neosolarized').setup({
    comment_italics = true,
    background_set = true,
  })
  -- for some reason some code actions get highlighted with WarningMsg and it's too much for me
  n.Group.link('WarningMsg', n.groups.Comment)

  vim.cmd("colorscheme neosolarized")
EOF
```

You could also just set the color or style, i.e.,:

```
  n.Group.new('TODO', n.colors.blue, n.colors.none, n.styles.underlined + n.styles.bold)
```

The `Group` above is from [colorbuddy](https://github.com/tjdevries/colorbuddy.vim). The
solarized colors are defined in n.colors and returned from setup().
